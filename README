Purpose: A website dedicated to parents looking for things to do around our city.
The site is meant to be a place where parents can find new/upcoming events and
submit their information to join a mailing list.The site also features a list of
the most recent events. This site was a passion-project as it's somethinig I've
seen done before but never really well.  

How to RUN: Run the index.html file and enjoy! 

Some things to know:
1. Breakpoints are evident in 3 container's photos (going from row, to column at md size in bootstrap and then scaling in size) as well as with the footer,
which breaks from two to a single column (when you get to the small size in bootstrap)
2. You'll see usage of a modal and form features as well as a responsive nav
3. You'll also see integration of Google's map location features
