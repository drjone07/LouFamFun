# LouFamFun
Purpose: A website dedicated to parents looking for things to do around our city.
The site is meant to be a place where parents can find new/upcoming events and
submit their information to join a mailing list.The site also features a list of
the most recent events. This site was a passion-project as it's somethinig I've
seen done before but never really well. 

How to RUN: Run the index.html file and enjoy!
